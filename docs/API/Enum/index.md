## Getting Started

This module provides a system for creating and managing enums in Luau.

Enums are useful for creating named constants that represent specific values,
making code more readable and maintainable.

Features:

- Create enums with string keys and numeric values
- Automatic value assignment based on order
- Enum caching to prevent duplicate creation
- Type-safe enum access
- Frozen enums to prevent modification
