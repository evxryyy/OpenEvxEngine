## Getting Started

`Buffer.Enum` is a utility inside Buffer that allows you to access every existing type that you can write.

This allows you to directly enumerate all available types.
Note that each type will have a `Value` (number in order) and `Name` which will be the type name.
It works exactly like the Enum class itself.
