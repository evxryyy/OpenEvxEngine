# Getting Started

!!! warning 

    These modules can be really complex due to their low-level design specified for more 
    performance and flexibility.

----

## API Presentation

To begin, this open-source library was created in mid-August 2025 by {==@Evxry==} (me) to give 
Roblox developers more ease but also more performance gains when developing games 
(small or large).

!!! Note "Precautions"

    Most of these files are often updated with each module. At the beginning of the page, 
    the latest version will be displayed. Please verify carefully.

## Who This Library Is For

This library mainly targets people who want to create their own complete system, for example 
a secure ECS for all data, remotes, security, etc. If you just want an easy-to-use library that does
everything for you, this is not for you.

----

## Additional Information
People can modify and publish this library, BUT they must send me a Discord message so I can 
give them permission to publish.

----

## Missing modules

For missing modules like `SyncHandler` , `SyncSignal` and `ModuleLoader` will be back when it will be ready and not just a wrapper or a basic loader.
